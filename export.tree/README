This is data from an fMRI experiment which tests a number of basic sensory and cognitive functions.

Full details of the task and methods can be found in our pre-print on BiorXiv.org; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/14/233783

There are two variants of the experiment. Both contain visual, auditory, and motor trials but one version also includes eye-movement trials, and another includes working-memory trials. They are labelled 'eye-movement' and 'working_memory' accordingly.

Two identical scanning sessions were conducted on each of 15 subjects. This enabled calculation of reliability statistics (ICC) as well as standard activation analyses.

Unthresholded activation maps and ICC maps are available here: https://neurovault.org/collections/3264/

Stimulus code for the tasks was written in PsychoPy and is also available here: https://figshare.com/articles/fMRI_control_task_zip/5162065 (DOI:
384 10.6084/m9.figshare.5162065).
